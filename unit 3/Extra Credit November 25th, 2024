# 1. What is a function? Why do we use functions in programming?
# A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task.
# We use functions to make programs modular, improve code reusability, simplify debugging, 
# and make code easier to read and maintain.

# 2. Function to calculate a number by 12 and subtract 5
def calculate_number(number):
    result = (number * 12) - 5
    print(f"Result of calculating {number}: {result}")

# 3. Function to welcome someone to a coding class
def welcome_message(name):
    message = f"Hello {name}! Welcome to coding!"
    print(message)

# 4. Function to compare a number to 17
def compare_to_17(number):
    if number > 17:
        print(f"{number} is greater than 17: True")
    else:
        print(f"{number} is greater than 17: False")

# 5. Function to show instructions for making a cheesesteak sandwich
def cheesesteak_instructions():
    print("How to make a cheesesteak sandwich:")
    print("1. Cook thinly sliced beef in a skillet.")
    print("2. Melt provolone or American cheese on the beef.")
    print("3. Toast a hoagie roll and place the beef and cheese inside.")
    print("4. Optionally add saut√©ed onions, peppers, or mushrooms.")
    print("5. Serve warm and enjoy!")

# 6. Difference between function call and function definition:
# - Function Definition: This is where the function is created.
# Example:
# def example_function():
#     print("This is a function definition.")

# - Function Call: This is when the function is executed.
# Example:
# example_function()  # This is a function call.

# Example usage of all functions
calculate_number(7)               # Adjust number for testing
welcome_message("Alex")           # Adjust name for testing
compare_to_17(20)                 # Adjust number for testing
cheesesteak_instructions()        # Call to display instructions
