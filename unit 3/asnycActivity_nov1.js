# 1. Create two variables that add up to 245
num1 = 120
num2 = 125
print(num1 + num2)  # This will output 245

# 2. Data type for a calendar app:
# - For the days of the week, I would use a list or tuple, as these can store multiple values (each day).
# - For the date, I would use an integer, since dates are whole numbers that represent days in a month.

# 3. Difference between float and integer:
# - A float is a number that has a decimal point (e.g., 3.14), while an integer is a whole number without decimals (e.g., 42).

# 4. Identifying the correct data type for each scenario:

# - A comment section on a picture on Instagram: This would be a string data type, as comments are text.
# - A survey form that asks if users have traveled to another country: A boolean (True or False) data type would be suitable here.
# - Suggestions for class improvements: A list of strings would work well to store multiple suggestions, or a single string if there's only one response.

# 5. Suggestions for class improvements (example):
# - "More hands-on projects to apply concepts."
# - "Extra practice sessions for challenging topics."
# - "Better explanation of difficult concepts with real-life examples."
